## [Orbital Probability Density Function (oPDF)](http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF)
`oPDF` is a code for modelling the phase space distribution of steady-state tracers in spherical potentials. It is written in `C` and parallelized with `OpenMP` for speed, with a `Python` frontend for ease of use. It is also highly modularized and easily extensible.

## Documentation
The full documentation is available in the doc/ directory, [or read it here]().
