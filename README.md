`oPDF` is a code for modelling the phase space distribution of steady-state tracers in spherical potentials. It is written in `C` and parallelized with `OpenMP`, with a `Python` frontend. In other words, it is both fast and convenient!

To get started, check the tutorial in the file py/tutorial.ipynb. You can use this tutorial interactively (i.e., run the codes in-place) if you can run the following command from the directory of this file:

    ipython notebook --pylab=inline

If that doesn't work, you can read it online as a webpage [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Kambrian/oPDF/blob/master/py/tutorial.ipynb). 

Please consult the science paper on how these work.
