## [Orbital Probability Density Function (oPDF)](http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF)
`oPDF` is a code for modelling the phase space distribution of steady-state tracers in spherical potentials. It is written in `C` and parallelized with `OpenMP`, with a `Python` frontend. In other words, it is both **fast** and **convenient**! It is also highly modulized and easily extensible.
