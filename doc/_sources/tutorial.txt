oPDF tutorial
=============

``oPDF`` is a code for modelling the phase space distribution of
steady-state tracers in spherical potentials. For more information,
check the `website <http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF>`_.

Please consult the science paper(http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00769) on how
it works.

You can use this tutorial interactively in ipython notebook by running

::

    ipython notebook --pylab=inline

from the root directory of the oPDF code. This will open your browser,
and you can click ``tutorial.ipynb`` in the opened webpage. If that does
not work, then simply continue reading this document as a webpage. For
the full API documentation, check
`here <http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF/doc/api>`_.

Getting Started
---------------

prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The oPDF code depends on the following libraries:

-  C libraries

   -  `GSL <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_
   -  `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_

-  Python libraries

   -  `numpy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy>`_,
      `scipy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy>`_,
      `matplotlib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib>`_
   -  `iminuit <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iminuit>`_ (optional, only
      needed if you want to do NFW-likelihood fit to the density profile
      of dark matter. If you don't have it, you need to comment out the
      ``iminuit`` related imports in the header of oPDF.py.)

You can customize the makefile to specify how to compile and link
against the GSL and HDF5 libraries, by specifying the
``GSLINC,GSLLIB,HDFINC,HDFLIB`` flags.

Build the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

under the root directory of the code, run

::

    make

This will generate the library ``liboPDF.so``, the backend of the python
module. Now you are all set up for the analysis. Open your python shell
in the code directory, and get ready for the modelling. If you want to
get rid of all the ``*.o`` files, you can clean them by

::

    make clean

Set PYTHONPATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From now on, you should either work under the current directory, or have
added the ``oPDF`` path to your ``PYTHONPATH`` before using ``oPDF`` in
python. To add the path, do

::

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$OPDF_DIR

in bash, or the following in csh:

::

    setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:$OPDF_DIR

. Replace ``$OPDF_DIR`` with the actual root directory of the ``oPDF``
code above.

Prepare the data files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data files are `hdf5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ files listing
the *physical* positions and velocities of tracer particles, relative to
the position and velocity of the center of the halo. The code comes with
a sample file under data/:

-  mockhalo.hdf5, a mock stellar halo. The potential is NFW with
   :math:`M=133.96\times 10^{10}M_\odot/h`\ , :math:`c=16.16`\ ,
   following the :math:`\rho_{\rm vir}=200\rho_{\rm crit}` definition.

Compulsory datasets in a data file:

-  ``x, shape=[nx3], datatype=float32``. The position of each particle.
-  ``v, shape=[nx3], datatyep=float32``. The velocity of each particle.

Optional datasets:

-  ``PartMass, [nx1] or 1, float32``. This is the mass of particles.
   Assuming 1 if not specified.
-  ``SubID, [nx1], int32``. This is the subhalo id of each particle, for
   examination of the effects of subhaloes during the analysis.
-  ``HaloID, [nx1], int32``. This is the host halo id of each particles.

The default system of units are
:math:`10^{10} M_\odot/h, {\rm kpc}/h, {\rm km/s}` for Mass, Length and
Velocity. If the units in the data differ from this system, you can
choose to either update the data so that they follows the default
systems, or change the system of units of oPDF code at run time. See the
units section of this tutorial.

*Note*: to construct a tracer sample for a halo, do not use FoF
particles alone. Instead, make a spherical selection by including all
the particles inside a given radius. These will include FoF particles,
background particles, and particles from other FoFs. FoF selection
should be avoided because it is an arbitrary linking of particles
according to their separations, but not dynamics.

A simple example: Fit the mock halo with RBinLike
-------------------------------------------------

Load the data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's import the module first

.. code:: python

    from oPDF import *
Now the ``oPDFdir`` should have been automatically set to the directory
of the ``oPDF`` code. Let's load the sample data

.. code:: python

    datafile=oPDFdir+"/data/mockhalo.hdf5"
    FullSample=Tracer(datafile)
    Sample=FullSample.copy(0,1000)
This will load the data into FullSample, and make a subsample of 1000
particles from the FullSample (starting from particle 0 in FullSample).
You may want to do your analysis with the full sample. We extract the
subsample just for illustrution purpose, to speed up the calculation in
this tutorial.

Perform the fitting.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's fit the data with the radial binned likelihood estimator with
10 logarithmic radial bins.

.. code:: python

    Estimators.RBinLike.nbin=10
    x,fval,status=Sample.dyn_fit(Estimators.RBinLike)
    print x,fval,status

.. parsed-literal::

    [ 100.43937117   26.62967127] 5020.3693017 1


In one or two minutes, you will get the results above, where

-  ``x`` is the best-fitting parameters
-  ``fval`` is the maximum log-likelihood value
-  ``status`` =1 means fitting is successful, =0 means fit failed.

That's it! You have got the best-fitting
:math:`M=100.44\times10^{10} M_\odot/h` and :math:`c=26.63`\ . ###
Estimate significances How does that compare to the real parameters of
:math:`M=133.96\times 10^{10}M_\odot/h`\ , :math:`c=16.16`\ ? Not too
bad, but let's check the likelihood ratio of the two models

.. code:: python

    x0=[133.96,16.16]
    f0=Sample.likelihood(x0, Estimators.RBinLike)
    likerat=2*(fval-f0)
    print likerat

.. parsed-literal::

    2.78983807112


So we got a likelihood ratio of 2.79. How significant is that? According
to Wilks's theorem, if the data follows the null model (with the real
parameters), then the likelihood ratio between the best-fit and the null
would follow a :math:`\chi^2` distribution. Since we have two free
parameters, we should compare our likelihood ratio to a
:math:`\chi^2(dof=2)` distribution. We can obtain the pval from the
survival function of a :math:`\chi^2` distribution, and convert that to
a Guassian significance level. This is automatically done by the
Chi2Sig() utility function

.. code:: python

    from myutils import Chi2Sig
    significance=Chi2Sig(likerat, dof=2)
    print significance

.. parsed-literal::

    1.15557973053


So the best-fitting differs from the real parameters by
:math:`\sim1\sigma`\ . It seems we are not very lucky and the fit is
only marginally consistent with the real parameters, but still
acceptable.

Confidence Contour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following the same philosophy for the significance levels, we can start
to define confidence contours formed by points that differ from the
best-fitting parameters by a given significance level. This is done by
scanning a likelihood surface and then converting it to a significance
surface. For example, below we scan :math:`20\times20` grids around the
best-fitting parameters ``x``, inside a box spanning from
``log10(x)-dx`` to ``log10(x)+dx`` in each dimension. For the confidence
levels of RBinLike, we can provide the maximum likelihood value that we
obtained above, to save the function from searching for maxlike itself.
Be prepared that the scan can be slow.

.. code:: python

    m,c,sig,like=Sample.scan_confidence(Estimators.RBinLike, x, ngrids=[20,20], dx=[0.5,0.5], logscale=True, maxlike=fval)
The returned ``m,c`` are the grids (1-d vectors) of the scan, and
``sig,like`` are the significance levels and likelihood values on the
grids (2-d array). Now let's plot them in units of the real parameter
values:

.. code:: python

    plt.contour(m/x0[0],c/x0[1],sig,levels=[1,2,3]) #1,2,3sigma contours.
    plt.plot(x[0]/x0[0],x[1]/x0[1],'ro') #the best-fitting
    plt.plot(plt.xlim(),[1,1], 'k--', [1,1], plt.ylim(),  'k--')# the real parameters
    plt.loglog()
    plt.xlabel(r'$M/M_0$')
    plt.ylabel(r'$c/c_0$')



.. parsed-literal::

Phase Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~

How does the data look in :math:`(\theta,E,L)` space? We can create
images showing the distribution of particles in these coordinates. These
images give a direct visualization of how uniformly the tracer are
distributed along :math:`\theta`\ -direction, on different (:math:`E,L`\ )
orbits. They are quite useful for spotting deviations from
steady-stateness in particular regions in phase space, for example, to
examine local deviations caused by subhaloes.

To avoid having too few particles in each pixel we will start by drawing
a larger sample as NewSample, and then plot the images adopting the real
potential with parameters ``x0``.

.. code:: python

    NewSample=FullSample.copy(0,20000)
.. code:: python

    plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
    plt.subplot(1,2,1)
    NewSample.phase_image(x0, proxy='E')
    plt.title('Real Potential')
    plt.subplot(1,2,2)
    NewSample.phase_image(x0, proxy='L')
    plt.title('Real Potential')



.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0x4d04b50>




.. image:: tutorial_files/tutorial_19_1.png


We can see that the particle distribution is indeed uniform (roughly
given the current resolution) along the :math:`\theta`\ -direction,
irrespective of the energy and angular momentum.

TS profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want a more quantitative view of how much deviation there is at
each :math:`E`\ , :math:`L` or even :math:`r`\ , you can plot the mean
phase deviation or AD distance (Test Statistics, or TS) inside different
:math:`(E,L,r)` bins.

.. code:: python

    plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))
    for i,proxy in enumerate('rEL'):
        plt.subplot(1,3,i+1)
        NewSample.plot_TSprof(x0, proxy, nbin=30)
        plt.plot(plt.xlim(), [0,0], 'k--')


.. image:: tutorial_files/tutorial_22_0.png


See, the mean phase deviations are within 3:math:`\sigma` almost
everywhere. Note that the raw mean phase is a standard normal variable
if the tracer is in steady-state under the potential.

Reconstructing the mass profile with Phase-Mark method
------------------------------------------------------

The phase-mark method can reconstruct the mass profile
non-parametrically. The reconstructed profile is typically noisier than
that from parametric fitting, but it's non-parametric. Now we
demonstrate how this can be done. First let's create some radial bins. A
natural choice is to create bins with equal sample size,

.. code:: python

    xbin=Sample.gen_bin('r', nbin=5, equalcount=True)
This generates a sequence containing the edges of 3 (``nbin=3``) radial
bins. The "phase marks", i.e., the characteristic mass point in each bin
can be found with the ``phase_mass_bin`` function:

.. code:: python

    marks=np.array([Sample.phase_mass_bin(xbin[[i,i+1]]) for i in xrange(len(xbin)-1)])
    print marks

.. parsed-literal::

    [[  2.57914729   1.00683005   0.49058258   1.36649516   1.           1.
        1.        ]
     [ 10.7295808   34.19465065  23.87852203  41.14360851   1.           1.
        1.        ]
     [ 20.34998195  11.30505188   2.16321596  32.20870383   1.           1.
        1.        ]
     [ 33.25517089  44.79736911  29.35628579  66.65986211   1.           1.
        1.        ]
     [ 64.34329628  68.22149098  60.10142383  77.56745713   1.           1.
        1.        ]]


The ``marks`` is now a [nbin, 6] array, where each row contains one
characteristic mass point. The columns are
``[r,m,ml,mu,flag,flagl, flagu]``, where ``r`` and ``m`` give the
characteristic radius and characteristic halo mass; ``ml`` and ``mu``
give the lower and upper bound on ``m``; ``flag``, ``flagl``,``flagu``
are convergence flags indicating whether the method has converged when
solving for ``m``,``ml`` and ``mu`` respectively (0:no; 1:yes; 2: no
solution to the phase equation, but closest point found). The points we
can trust must at least have ``flag=1``. If one wants robust error
estimates, then ``flagl=1`` and ``flagu=1`` is also required. All our
data points have flag==1, meaning the fits are all successful, so we do
not need to worry about this below.

We can also fit a functional form to the phase marks. We use the
``curve_fit`` function from the ``scipy.optimize`` package to do the fit
(need ``scipy`` version ``>0.15.1`` in order to use ``absolute_sigma=1``
in ``curve_fit``). We will use the average of the upper and lower
errors, but this is not essential.

.. code:: python

    halofit=Halo(HaloTypes.NFWMC)
    def halomass(r, m,c):
      halofit.set_param([m,c])
      return halofit.mass(r)
    
    from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
    err1=marks[:,3]-marks[:,1]
    err2=marks[:,1]-marks[:,2]
    err=(err1+err2)/2 
    par,Cov=curve_fit(halomass, marks[:,0], marks[:,1], sigma=err, p0=[100, 10], absolute_sigma=1)
    print 'Fitted parameters:', par
    print 'Parameter Errors:', np.sqrt(np.diagonal(Cov))

.. parsed-literal::

    Fitted parameters: [ 123.24507653   14.92927574]
    Parameter Errors: [ 24.43777446   4.36420908]


The fitted parameters make sense. Now let's plot the marks, the fit to
marks, and compare to the true mass profile:

.. code:: python

    fig=plt.figure()
    plt.errorbar(marks[:,0], marks[:,1], yerr=[err2, err1], fmt='ro', label='Mark')
    r=np.logspace(0,2,10)
    plt.plot(r, halomass(r, par[0], par[1]), 'r-', label='Mark Fit')
    
    #true mass profile:
    halo=Halo()
    halo.set_param(x0) #x0 are the true parameters
    plt.plot(r, halo.mass(r), 'k-', label='True')
    
    plt.legend(loc=4)
    plt.xscale('log')
    plt.yscale('log')
    plt.xlabel('r')
    plt.ylabel('M(<r)')



.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0x5217250>




.. image:: tutorial_files/tutorial_31_1.png


If one is more interested in fitting parametric functions to the
reconstructed profiles, then we recommend to use only 2 radial bins.
Adopting more radial bins lead to finer reconstruction of the profile,
but also leaks some information so the final fit to the marks can be
less accurate. We provide a compact function to combine the steps for
fitting phase marks into a single step. For example, to fit with two
bins, do

.. code:: python

    par2,Cov2,marks2=Sample.phase_mark_fit(par0=[100,10], nbin=2)
    print 'mark flags:\n', marks2[:,4:]
    print 'Fitted parameters:', par2
    print 'Parameter Errors:', np.sqrt(np.diagonal(Cov2))

.. parsed-literal::

    mark flags:
    [[ 1.  1.  1.]
     [ 1.  1.  1.]]
    Fitted parameters: [ 124.0093333    19.67968255]
    Parameter Errors: [ 16.39555491   3.99462691]


As you can see, now the parameter errors are smaller. The functional
form of the profile used in the fitting is controlled by the current
``Sample.halo``. To use a disired profile, set the halo type **before**
fitting. For example,

.. code:: python

    Sample.halo.set_type(HaloTypes.NFWMC, scales=[1,1])
To plot the fit,

.. code:: python

    fig=plt.figure()
    plt.errorbar(marks2[:,0], marks2[:,1], yerr=[marks2[:,1]-marks2[:,2], marks2[:,3]-marks2[:,1]], fmt='ro', label='Mark')
    
    Sample.halo.set_param(par2)
    plt.plot(r, Sample.halo.mass(r), 'r-', label='Mark Fit')
    plt.plot(r, halo.mass(r), 'k-', label='True')
    plt.legend(loc=4)
    plt.xscale('log')
    plt.yscale('log')
    plt.xlabel('r')
    plt.ylabel('M(<r)')

Customizing the analysis
------------------------

Estimators
~~~~~~~~~~

There are several predefined estimators to choose from when you need an
estimator as a parameter. These are listed as members of ``Estimators``.
In most cases, you can freely choose from the following when an
estimator is required.

-  Estimators.RBinLike
-  Estimators.AD
-  Estimators.MeanPhase
-  Estimators.MeanPhaseRaw (same as MeanPhase but returns the un-squared
   mean phase deviation, so it is a standard normal variable instead of
   a chi-square for MeanPhase).

For RBinLike, you can also customize the number of radial bins and
whether to bin in linear or log scales. For example, the following will
change the RBinLike to use 20 linear bins.

.. code:: python

    Estimators.RBinLike.nbin=20
    Estimators.RBinLike.logscale=False
You can then pass this customized ``Estimators.RBinLike`` to your
likelihood functions. Since the purpose of the binning is purely to
suppress shot noise, a larger number of bins is generally better, as
long as it is not too noisy. On the other hand, when the likelihood
contours appear too irregular, one should try reducing the number of
radial bins to ensure the irregularities are not caused by shot noise.
In our analysis, we have adopted 30 logarithmic bins for an ideal sample
of 1000 particles, and 50 bins for :math:`10^6` particles in a realistic
halo, although a bin number as low as 5 could still work.

units
~~~~~

The system of units is specified in three fundamental units:
Mass[:math:`M_\odot/h`\ ], Length[kpc/:math:`h`\ ], Velocity[km/s]. You
can query the current units with

.. code:: python

    Globals.get_units()

.. parsed-literal::

    Mass  : 10000000000.0 Msun/h
    Length: 1.0 kpc/h
    Vel   : 1.0 km/s




.. parsed-literal::

    (10000000000.0, 1.0, 1.0)



The default units are [:math:`10^{10} M_\odot/h`\ , kpc/:math:`h`\ ,
km/s]. The oPDF code does not need to know the value of the hubble
constant :math:`h`\ , as long as the units are correctly specified. It
is the user's responsibility to make sure that his/her units are
consistent with his assumed hubble parameter.

If you want to change the system of units, you must do it immediately
after importing the ``oPDF`` module, to avoid inconsistency with units
of previously loaded tracers. For example, if your data is provided in
units of (1e10Msun, kpc, km/s), and you adopt :math:`h=0.73` in your
model, then you can set the units like below

.. code:: python

    from oPDF import *
    h=0.73
    Globals.set_units(1e10*h,h,1)
That is, to set them to (:math:`10^{10}h` Msun/:math:`h`\ , :math:`h`\ kpc/:math:`h`\ ,
km/s).

The user should only use Globals.set\_units() to change the units, which
automatically updates several interal constants related to units. Never
try to change the internal unit variables (e.g.,
Globals.units.MassInMsunh) manually.

cosmology
~~~~~~~~~

The cosmology parameters (:math:`\Omega_{M0}`\ ,
:math:`\Omega_{\Lambda0}`\ )can be accessed through

.. code:: python

    print Globals.cosmology.OmegaM0, Globals.cosmology.OmegaL0

.. parsed-literal::

    0.3 0.7


To change the cosmology to (0.25, 0.75), simply do

.. code:: python

    Globals.cosmology.OmegaM0=0.25
    Globals.cosmology.OmegaL0=0.75
Again this is advised to be done in the beginning, to avoid
inconsistency in the calculations.

parametrization of the potential
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default parameterization of the potential is a NFW potential with
mass and concentration parameters. You can change the parametrization of
the halo associated with your tracer. For example, if you want to fit
for :math:`(\rho_s,r_s)` instead of (:math:`M,c`\ ), then

.. code:: python

    Sample.halo.set_type(halotype=HaloTypes.NFWRhosRs)
Available types are listed as members of the ``HaloTypes`` objects,
including:

-  HaloTypes.NFWMC: NFW halo parametrized by :math:`(M,c)`
-  HaloTypes.NFWRhosRs: NFW, :math:`(\rho_s,r_s)`
-  HaloTypes.NFWPotsRs: NFW, (:math:`\psi_s, r_s`\ ), with
   :math:`\psi_s=4\pi G\rho_s r_s^2`\ .
-  HaloTypes.CorePotsRs: Cored Generalized NFW Potential (inner density
   slope=0), parametrized by (:math:`\psi_s,r_s`\ )
-  HaloTypes.CoreRhosRs: Cored GNFW, :math:`(\rho_s,r_s)`
-  HaloTypes.TMPMC: Template profile, :math:`(M,c)` parametrization
-  HaloTypes.TMPPotScaleRScale: Template,
   :math:`\psi_s/\psi_{s0}, r_s/r_{s0}`

To use template profiles, you have to create them first, in the form of
(:math:`r,\psi,\rho(< r)`\ ) arrays and the real :math:`r_s` parameter
to be added to C/TemplateData.h. You need to recompile the C library
once this is done. PotentialProf.py can help you in generating the
templates from DM distributions.

If you use template profiles, you also need to specify the template id,
to tell the code which template in TemplateData.h to use. For example,

.. code:: python

    Sample.halo.set_type(halotype=HaloTypes.TMPPotScaleRScale, TMPid=5)
You can also change the virial definition and redshift of the halo, for
example:

.. code:: python

    Sample.halo.set_type(virtype=VirTypes.B200, redshift=0.1)
When fitting for the potential, it is always a good choice to adjust the
scales of parameters so that the numerical values of the parameters are
of order 1. oPDF allows you to change the scale of the parameters. The
physical values of the parameters will be the raw parameters times the
scale of parameters. By default, the scales are all set to unity. We can
change them as

.. code:: python

    Sample.halo.set_type(scales=[100,10])
Now if we fit the Sample again with the RBinLike estimator, instead of
``x=[ 118.18    19.82]``, we will get ``x=[1.1818    1.982]`` as the
best fit, but the physical values are not changed.

Halos
^^^^^

Each tracer is associated with a halo. You can also work with a seperate
halo object. There are several methods associated with a halo object.
You can set\_type(), set\_param(), get the mass and potential profiles

.. code:: python

    halo=Halo(halotype=HaloTypes.NFWMC)
    halo.set_param([180,15])
    r=np.logspace(0,2,10)
    plt.figure(figsize=(16,4))
    plt.subplot(121)
    plt.loglog(r, halo.mass(r))
    plt.xlabel('r')
    plt.ylabel('M(<r)')
    plt.subplot(122)
    plt.loglog(r, -halo.pot(r))
    plt.xlabel('r')
    plt.ylabel(r'$-\psi(r)$')

selecting and cutting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following line applies a radial cut from 1 to 100 in system unit.
Note it not only selects particles to have :math:`1<r<100`\ , but also
sets the radial boundary for the dynamical model, so that only dyanmical
consistency inside the selected radial range is checked.

.. code:: python

    Sample.radial_cut(1,100)
This creates a subsample by selecting high angular momentum (L>1e4)
particles:

.. code:: python

    SubSample=Sample.select(Sample.data['L']>1e4)
All the particle data can be accessed from the record array Sample.data.
You can do similar selections (and many other operations) on any
available fields of the data (except for radial selection). Have a look
at the datatype or ``Particle_t._fields_`` to see the available fields

Note:

-  The dynamical method tests the radial distribution, so one should
   avoid distorting the radial distribution with any radial selection.
   One can still apply radial cuts, but should only do this with the
   ``Sample.radial_cut(rmin,rmax)`` function.
-  The ``w`` field is the particle mass in units of the average particle
   mass. The average particle mass is ``Sample.mP``. These are all ones
   if no particle mass is given in the datafile.
-  the ``haloid`` and ``subid`` fields are only filled if you have
   ``SubID`` and ``HaloID`` datasets in the datafile when loading.
-  The ``E``, ``theta`` and ``rlim`` fields are the energy, phase-angle,
   and radial limits (peri and apo-center distances) of the orbits.
   These depend on the potential, and are only filled when you have done
   some calculation in a halo or have filled them explicitly with the
   set\_phase() function, e.g.,

.. code:: python

    Sample.set_phase(x0)
    print Sample.data['E'][10]
    print Sample.data['theta'][35]

Extending the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add new types of potential:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  in C/halo.h: add your HaloType identifier in HaloType\_t
-  in C/halo.c:

   -  write your halo initializer in halo\_set\_param().
   -  write your potential function in halo\_pot()
   -  optionally, write your cumulative mass profile in halo\_mass(),
      and add any initilization in halo\_set\_type() if needed.

-  in oPDF.py:

   -  add your newly defined halotype to the following line
      ``HaloTypes=NamedEnum(...``

To add new template profiles:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Generate your template in the form of (:math:`r,\psi,\rho(< r)`\ )
   arrays, and append to ``PotentialTemplate`` in ``C/TemplateData.h``.
-  Append the scale radius of the new template to ``TemplateScale`` in
   ``C/TemplateData.h``. This is only used if you want to use ``TMPMC``
   parametrization. In this case the scale radius must be the radius
   with respect to which you define the concentration. That is, you must
   make sure when you input the real :math:`M,c` parameters to the
   template, and I convert :math:`Rv` from :math:`M` and then compare to
   this scale radius, I get the real :math:`c` that you input.
-  :math:`\rho(<r)` and :math:`r_s` are only needed if you want to use
   ``TMPMC`` parametrization. If you only want to use
   ``TMPPotScaleRScale`` parametrization, you can fill :math:`\rho(<r)`
   and :math:`r_s` with ones or any value.

To add new estimators:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  check ``C/models.c``.

You need to recompile the C library once this is done.
``PotentialProf.py`` can help you in generating the templates from DM
distributions.

Additional Features
-------------------

Parallel jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The C backend of oPDF is fully parallelized with ``OpenMP`` for parallel
computation on shared memory machines. To control the number of threads
used, for example to use 16 threads, set the environment variable

::

    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16

in bash or

::

     setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 16

in csh before running.

When submitting python scripts containing ``oPDF`` calculations to a
batch system on a server, try to submit to a shared memory node and
request more than one CPUs on the node to make use of the parallel
power.

Memory management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each loaded tracer is associated with a memory block in C. If you are
certain you no longer need the tracer, you can clean it to free up
memory. For example,

.. code:: python

    NewSample.clean()
will clear our previously created NewSample. If you know you only need
the tracer for certain operations, you can automate the loading and
cleaning process by using ``with`` statement:

.. code:: python

    with Tracer(datafile) as TempSample:
        NewSample=TempSample.copy(0,100)
This will load the datafile into ``TempSample``, create ``NewSample``
from ``TempSample``, and clear ``TempSample`` when exiting the ``with``
block.

Bootstrap sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create bootstrap samples (sample with replacement), just sample with
a different seed each time

.. code:: python

    BSSample=Sample.resample(seed=123)
NFW-likelihood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To fit a spatial distribution of particles to an NFW profile (e.g.,
fitting the distribution of dark matter particles in a halo)

.. code:: python

    Sample.NFW_fit()

In order for this to make sense, ``Sample`` should be loaded with dark
matter particles of equal particle mass given in ``Sample.mP``, and the
number density profile times ``Sample.mP`` should give the physical
density profile.

You also need the `iminuit <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iminuit>`_
python package before you can use this function. If you don't have that,
you need to comment out the ``iminuit`` related imports in the header of
``oPDF.py``. Please consult the ``iminuit`` documentation for the
``iminuit`` outputs.

Numerical precision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The relative precision for integration of orbits is controlled by
``Globals.tol.rel``, which defaults to ``1e-3``. You can adjust the
numerical accuracy (either for speed or for accuracy concerns), by
assigning to ``Globals.tol.rel``. For example,

.. code:: python

    Globals.tol.rel=1e-2
Typically a value of ``1e-2`` should be sufficient for most applications
such as likelihood inference or phase angle evaluation. Of course, the
lower the precision, the faster the code will be.
