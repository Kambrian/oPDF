oPDF
----------------------------------
`oPDF` (Orbital Probability Density Function) is a code for modelling the phase space distribution of steady-state tracers in spherical potentials. It is written in `C` and parallelized with `OpenMP` for speed, with a `Python` frontend for ease of use. It is also highly modularized and easily extensible.
