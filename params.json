{"name":"oPDF","tagline":"Orbital Probability Density Function","body":"## Orbital Probability Density Function (oPDF)\r\n`oPDF` is a code for modelling the phase space distribution of steady-state tracers in spherical potentials. It is written in `C` and parallelized with `OpenMP`, with a `Python` frontend. In other words, it is both fast and convenient!\r\n\r\n##Tutorial\r\nTo get started, check the tutorial in the file \r\n\r\n    py/tutorial.ipynb\r\n\r\nYou can use this tutorial interactively (i.e., run the codes in-place) if you can run the following command from the py/ directory of the code:\r\n\r\n    ipython notebook --pylab=inline\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work, you can read it online [as a webpage here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Kambrian/oPDF/blob/master/py/tutorial.ipynb). \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease consult the science paper on how these work. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Authors\r\nJiaxin Han (@Kambrian)[ICC, Durham]","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
