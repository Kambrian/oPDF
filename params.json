{"name":"oPDF","tagline":"Orbital Probability Density Function","body":"## Orbital Probability Density Function (oPDF)\r\n`oPDF` is a code for modelling the phase space distribution of steady-state tracers in spherical potentials. It is written in `C` and parallelized with `OpenMP` for speed, with a `Python` frontend for ease of use. It is also highly modularized and easily extensible.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- [Full HTML documentations](http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF/doc). \r\n\r\n  The [tutorial](http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF/doc/tutorial) is the best place to start from. \r\n\r\n- PDF versions are available in the doc/ directory.\r\n\r\nPlease consult the science paper (coming soon) on how it works. \r\n\r\n## Authors\r\nJiaxin Han (@Kambrian)[ICC, Durham]\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
