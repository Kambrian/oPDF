{"name":"oPDF","tagline":"Orbital Probability Density Function","body":"## [Orbital Probability Density Function (oPDF)](http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF)\r\n`oPDF` is a code for modelling the phase space distribution of steady-state tracers in spherical potentials. It is written in `C` and parallelized with `OpenMP`, with a `Python` frontend. In other words, it is both **fast** and **convenient**! It is also highly modulized and easily extensible.\r\n\r\n##Tutorial\r\nTo get started, check the tutorial in the doc/ directory, [or read it here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Kambrian/oPDF/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease consult the science paper (coming soon) on how it works. \r\n\r\n##Authors\r\nJiaxin Han (@Kambrian)[ICC, Durham]\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
